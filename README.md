# Interview_Prep

## Introduction
- I have created this repository as part of my personal interview preparation
program.

- I will be solving coding exercises as I go over different data and algorithms.

- The goal is to solve about 200 problems in three months, that means solving from
two to three problems per day. I'll keep a record on this file with all the
problems I've solved.
