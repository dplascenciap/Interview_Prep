# Interview_Prep

## Introduction
- I have created this repository as part of my personal interview preparation 
program.

- I will solve coding exercises as I review different data and algorithms.

- The goal is to solve about 200 problems in three months, solving from two to 
three issues per day. I'll record all the problems I've solved in this file.

- I've divided the problems into different sections.
